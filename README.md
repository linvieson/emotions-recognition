# Emotions recognition

### Project name
Emotions recognition and analysis by photos on the Instargam profile

### Description
This project analyzes photos from Instagram profiles and 
returns information about the emotions of peoples in 
posts of that account. Also, it gives a comparison with 
the common percentage of different emotions and their 
distribution in the profile and the average statistical 
distribution of emotions in life. 

### Table of contents

### Installation
```python
pip install ???
```


### Usage
Just use that stuff

### Results
The result is obvious: the percentage of good emotions in 
Instagram is too high in competing with real-life, which 
says to us that it isn't a good idea to oppress yourself 
because you don't have everything as cool as 
the Instagram stars. They just hide a huge part of their 
bad life and show to followers only the bright side of it, 
mainly part of which was made exactly to get more likes.
